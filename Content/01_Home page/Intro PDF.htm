        <p>Puławy (pronounced [puˈwavɨ], also written Pulawy) is a city in eastern Poland, in Lesser Poland's Lublin <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="MyGlossary.Term1">Voivodeship</MadCap:glossaryTerm>, at the confluence of the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="MyGlossary.Term0">Vistula</MadCap:glossaryTerm> and Kurówka Rivers. Puławy is the capital of Puławy County. The city's 2019 population was estimated at 47,417. From 1846 to 1918, during the partitions of Poland, it was known as Nowa Aleksandria, or Nowo Aleksandria. Its coat of arms is the Pahonia.</p>
        <p>Puławy was first mentioned in documents of the 15th century. At that time it was spelled Pollavy, its name probably coming from a Vistula River ford located nearby. The town is a local center of science, industry and tourism, together with nearby <MadCap:xref href="../12_Nałęczów/Nałęczów.htm">"Nałęczów" on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref> and Kazimierz Dolny. Puławy is home to Poland's first permanent museum and is a Vistula River port.</p>
        <p>The town has two bridges and four rail stations, and serves as a road junction. Nearby Dęblin has a military airport.</p>
