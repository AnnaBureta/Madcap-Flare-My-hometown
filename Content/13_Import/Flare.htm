    <p>I googled "Madcap Flare documentation" and the search took me exactly where I wanted.</p>
    <p>Flare - Pros</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The software documentation is easy to find.</li>
      <li>Plain, easy-to-understand English.</li>
      <li>I liked the way the images are enlarged, e.g. <a href="https://help.madcapsoftware.com/flare2021r2/Content/Flare/Introduction/Features/General-Key-Features1.htm">here</a>. It looks really neat when an enlarged image pops up on the same page and not in another tab.</li>
      <li>A big plus! Thanks to the bar on the left side of the page, the reader knows where they are in the documentation tree:

      <li>The video <a href="https://help.madcapsoftware.com/flare2021r2/Content/Flare/Step4-Developing-Targets/Develop-Targets.htm">here</a> is conveniently divided into sections so you don't have to watch the whole thing if you are interested only in a specific output type: <img src="domowa14.png" alt="image" /></li>
      <li>At the beginning of every tutorial, the user learns how long it is going to take them to complete it: <img src="domowa15.png" alt="image" /></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Flare - Cons</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I did not like the two columns' layout <a href="https://help.madcapsoftware.com/flare2021r2/Content/Flare/Introduction/Get-Started.htm">here</a> because nowadays we are all pretty much used to scrolling.</li>
    </ol>
