        <p>Kazimierz Dolny (Polish pronunciation: [kaˈʑimjɛʐ ˈdɔlnɨ]) is a small historic town in east-central Poland, on the right (eastern) bank of the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="MyGlossary.Term0">Vistula</MadCap:glossaryTerm> river in Puławy County, Lublin <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="MyGlossary.Term1">Voivodeship</MadCap:glossaryTerm>. Historically it belongs to Lesser Poland, and in the past it used to be one of the most important cities of the province.</p>
        <p>Now a tourist destination, the town enjoyed its greatest prosperity in the 16th and the first half of the 17th century, due to the trade in grain conducted along the Vistula. It became an economic backwater after that trade declined, and this freeze in economic development enabled the town to preserve its Renaissance urban plan and appearance. Since the 19th century it has become a holiday destination, attracting artists and summer residents.</p>
        <p>Kazimierz Dolny is an art center in Poland. Many painters retreat to this small town to paint and sell their work. Galleries can be found in almost every street, offering for sale sculptures, stained-glass, folk art, and fine art.</p>
        <p>The town is one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (Pomnik historii), as designated September 16, 1994 and tracked by the National Heritage Board of Poland.</p>
